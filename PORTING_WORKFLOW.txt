Manual Upstream Porting Workflow

Repositories
- Personal repo: this repository
- Upstream work repo: /Users/luke/Developer/raycast-extensions-upstream
- Upstream remote: upstream (https://github.com/raycast/extensions.git)
- Fork remote: origin (https://github.com/lmoloney/extensions.git)

Daily flow
1) Build and validate in this personal repo.
2) Save source commit SHA from this repo.
3) Switch identity to upstream/store profile: `npm run profile:prod`.
4) Verify guardrail: `npm run profile:check-upstream`.
5) In /Users/luke/Developer/raycast-extensions-upstream, create a clean branch from upstream/main.
6) Port only the needed file changes into the matching extension folder.
7) Run lint/build in the upstream clone.
8) Commit and push branch to origin.
9) Open PR from lmoloney/extensions branch to raycast/extensions main.
10) Record source SHA -> upstream SHA mapping in porting-ledger.tsv.
11) Switch local repo back to dev identity: `npm run profile:dev`.
