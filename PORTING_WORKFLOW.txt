Manual Upstream Porting Workflow

Repositories
- Personal repo: this repository
- Upstream work repo: /Users/luke/Developer/raycast-extensions-upstream
- Upstream remote: upstream (https://github.com/raycast/extensions.git)
- Fork remote: origin (https://github.com/lmoloney/extensions.git)

Daily flow
1) Build and validate in this personal repo.
2) Save source commit SHA from this repo.
3) In /Users/luke/Developer/raycast-extensions-upstream, create a clean branch from upstream/main.
4) Port only the needed file changes into the matching extension folder.
5) Run lint/build in the upstream clone.
6) Commit and push branch to origin.
7) Open PR from lmoloney/extensions branch to raycast/extensions main.
8) Record source SHA -> upstream SHA mapping in porting-ledger.tsv.
